Streamlit Web App to convert an image of a horse into zebra and viceversa

In this project the user can select an image of a horse or zebra and one can convert it into the other animal. 
The project is made with two GAN models, one for the horse to zebra and the other one for zebra to horse. 

Of course, the user can select any image that can have already downloaded ready to use.
